# BTQ - Quantum-Resistant Bitcoin Ledger

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for BTQ, a cutting-edge Bitcoin Quantum Resistant Ledger designed to address the vulnerabilities posed by quantum computing. 

## Quantum Resistance Through XMSS
BTQ integrates the Extended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS), a stateful, hash-based signature scheme that bolsters our ledger against quantum threats. This advanced technology not only makes BTQ quantum-resistant but also ensures the security of transactions in the face of potential quantum computing advancements.

### Why XMSS?
- **Quantum-Resistant:** XMSS provides robust protection against the potential threat of quantum computers that could compromise traditional cryptographic algorithms.
- **Forward Secrecy:** Each transaction is safeguarded with one-time signatures, ensuring that past communications cannot be compromised even if future signatures are.

### Key Features
- **Stateful Signature Scheme:** Leverages the security properties of hash-based signatures to protect transactions.
- **Designed for Longevity:** Ideal for future-proofing Bitcoin transactions against evolving quantum technologies.

## Vision
Our goal is to make BTQ the standard for secure, quantum-resistant Bitcoin transactions, providing a resilient and efficient platform in the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology.

We invite developers, researchers, and enthusiasts in the field of cryptography and blockchain technology to contribute, explore, and help enhance BTQ. Together, we can build a safer blockchain future.
